# Introduction to Word Sense Disambiguation

Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of identifying the correct meaning of a word in a given context, when the word has multiple possible meanings. For example, the word “bank” can mean a financial institution, a river shore, or a verb meaning to tilt or turn. WSD aims to resolve this ambiguity and assign the appropriate sense to the word.

WSD is an important and challenging problem in natural language processing (NLP), as it affects the performance and accuracy of many NLP applications, such as machine translation, information retrieval, text summarization, question answering, and more. WSD can also help humans to better understand and communicate with natural language, especially in cross-lingual and multilingual scenarios.

In this chapter, we will introduce the basic concepts and terminology of WSD, such as:

- What are word senses and how are they defined and represented?
- What are the sources and types of word sense ambiguity?
- What are the main approaches and methods for WSD?
- What are the evaluation metrics and datasets for WSD?
- What are the current challenges and open issues in WSD research?

By the end of this chapter, you should have a clear overview of the WSD problem and its relevance to NLP. You should also be able to identify and analyze word sense ambiguity in natural language texts, and apply some basic WSD techniques to resolve it.
