# WSD Applications

Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is not only a fundamental problem in natural language processing (NLP), but also a useful component for many NLP applications that require semantic understanding and interpretation of natural language texts. In this chapter, we will survey some of the main applications of WSD in various domains and tasks, such as:

- Machine translation: WSD can help to select the correct translation of an ambiguous word in the target language, based on the context and the intended meaning of the word in the source language. For example, the English word “crane” can be translated into different words in Spanish, depending on whether it refers to a bird, a machine, or a verb. WSD can help to choose the appropriate word among “grulla”, “grúa”, or “estirar”.
- Information retrieval: WSD can help to improve the precision and recall of search engines, by matching the query terms with the relevant documents based on their senses, rather than their surface forms. For example, a user who searches for “apple” may be interested in the fruit, the company, or the singer. WSD can help to filter out the irrelevant documents and rank the relevant ones according to the user’s intent.
- Text summarization: WSD can help to generate concise and coherent summaries of long texts, by preserving the salient information and avoiding sense confusion. For example, a summary of a news article about a bank robbery should not use the word “bank” to mean a river shore or a verb, but only to mean a financial institution.
- Question answering: WSD can help to provide accurate and relevant answers to natural language questions, by resolving the ambiguity of the question terms and the answer candidates. For example, a question like “Who is the author of Hamlet?” may have different answers, depending on whether “Hamlet” refers to the play, the character, or the village. WSD can help to identify the correct sense of “Hamlet” and retrieve the corresponding answer.
- Text analysis: WSD can help to perform various types of text analysis, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text classification, text clustering, and more. By disambiguating the words in the text, WSD can help to capture the semantic features and relations of the text, and enhance the performance and accuracy of the analysis methods.

These are just some examples of the many applications of WSD in NLP and beyond. WSD can also be applied to other domains and tasks, such as speech recognition, natural language generation, biomedical text mining, educational technology, and more. WSD is a versatile and valuable technique that can enrich and improve the natural language understanding and processing capabilities of various systems and applications.
