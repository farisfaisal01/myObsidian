# Advances Toward Word-Sense Disambiguation

_Tawseef Ahmad Mir and Aadil Ahmad Lawaye_

> [!tldr] Summary This paper provides an overview of the word-sense disambiguation (WSD) problem, which is the task of identifying the correct meaning of a word in a given context, when the word has multiple possible meanings. The paper discusses the main categories of WSD approaches, such as knowledge-based, supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised, and their advantages and disadvantages. The paper also reviews the research work done in different languages for WSD, especially for resource deficit languages, and highlights the state-of-the-art performances and open challenges in this domain.

### Aim of Paper

- To explore the approaches and methods that are followed to find the solution to the WSD problem
- To highlight the merits and demerits of these approaches and methods
- To discuss the research work conducted in different languages for WSD, with a special focus on resource deficit languages
- To present the state-of-the-art performances achieved so far in this domain
- To identify the open challenges and issues in WSD research

#### Key insights

- WSD is a fundamental and challenging problem in natural language processing, as it affects the performance and accuracy of many NLP applications
- WSD approaches can be categorized into knowledge-based, supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised, depending on the source and type of knowledge used for disambiguation
- Knowledge-based approaches rely on dictionaries, thesauri, and lexical knowledge bases, without using any corpus evidence
- Supervised approaches use machine learning techniques to train a classifier for each word on a corpus of manually sense-annotated examples
- Semi-supervised approaches use a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance and coverage of WSD
- Unsupervised approaches cluster the occurrences of words based on their distributional similarity or contextual relatedness, without using any labeled data or predefined sense inventory
- Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, and there is no single best approach for all words and domains
- The choice of the best approach depends on the availability and quality of the data, the complexity and granularity of the word senses, the application and user requirements, and the evaluation criteria and metrics
- WSD research is constrained to few major languages, with little focus on resource deficit languages
- There is scope for developing WSD methods and resources for resource deficit languages, especially by leveraging multilingual and cross-lingual techniques
- WSD is still an open and active research area, with many challenges and opportunities for improvement and innovation
